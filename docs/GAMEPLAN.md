# Codimir I/O — Gameplan (Purpose, Adoption, Growth)

## Purpose
Create a seamless bridge between human intent and machine execution using a batteryless, privacy‑respecting voice interface.

## Core Goals
- Open reference hardware + firmware.
- Cross‑platform host + TypeScript SDK.
- Strong community and brand stewardship.

## Audiences
- Developers (IDE + OS control, ticket automation)
- Makers (embed batteryless voice in projects)
- Teams (voice‑triggered DevOps)

## Growth Phases
- Phase 1 — Foundation: release designs, SDK alpha, docs, CI.
- Phase 2 — Adoption: plug‑and‑play kits, build nights, “10 Days of Codimir”.
- Phase 3 — Ecosystem: third‑party adapters (Neovim/JetBrains/OS), hackathons.
- Phase 4 — Ubiquity: default dev tool; integrations into productivity suites.

## Key Plays
- Good‑first‑issues; weekly community sync; monthly demo videos.
- Starter packs: VS Code + Neovim bindings, ticket recipes.
- Security posture: allowlist actions, visible logs, signed frames.

## Metrics
- Time‑to‑first‑command (TTFC)
- Weekly active devices (WAD)
- Command success rate (CSR)
- Community contributions (PRs, adapters)

## Taglines
- Mind → Voice → Action
- Invent with Intent

# Theoretical Foundations

## Energy Harvesting Modes
- NFC inductive coupling (13.56 MHz)
- RF backscatter (reflect ambient RF)
- Acoustic → electrical (piezo)
- Solar → supercap

## From Vibration to Action
- Pressure → mic voltage → sampled → compressed → framed → field‑modulated → decoded → intent → action.

## Intent as a System Constraint
- Design for intentionality: PTT, explicit grammar, allowlists, auditability.

## Philosophy
- Clear intention reduces entropy between thought and result.
- Invent with Intent: treat speech as the smallest deployable unit of creation.

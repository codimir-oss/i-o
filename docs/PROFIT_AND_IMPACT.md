# Profit & Impact — Markets for Voice Activation

## Thesis
Enabling "voice → action" without batteries creates new markets while staying open‑source at the core.

## Value Creation
- Developers: save time, reduce context switches, new automation surfaces.
- Teams: faster execution, lower friction in ops and ticketing.
- Makers: embed batteryless voice in products.

## Monetization Paths (OSS‑friendly)
- Hardware kits: dev boards, assembled tags, coils, enclosures.
- Pro adapters: enterprise IDE/CI integrations, policy packs.
- Hosted relay: optional secure relay for org policies/audit.
- Support & training: workshops, certification, partner program.
- Marketplace: community command packs; revenue share.

## Invent with Intent Program
- Grants/bounties for impactful adapters and hardware variants.
- Spotlight community creators; curated marketplace inclusion.

## Go‑To‑Market
- Launch playbooks (HN/Reddit/dev.to, demo video, starter packs)
- Seed 10+ good‑first‑issues; monthly build streams
- Partnerships with IDE/plugin ecosystems

## Guardrails
- Trademark protection; security by default; transparent telemetry opt‑in only.

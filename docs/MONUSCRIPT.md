## 1) The Seed

An I/O device that does not require a battery. It awakens in the presence of energy around us (NFC, RF, light), listens briefly, encodes your words, and hands them to software that acts.

This is the bridge from thought → voice → action.

## 2) The Mission

- Publish an open hardware + firmware reference design for batteryless “tap‑to‑talk”.
- Ship a host + SDK that maps speech to IDE/OS/ticket actions.
- Grow a community that treats intention as an engineering primitive.

## 3) The Two Paths

- Pure mechanical (education): diaphragm + stylus engraves a groove. Zero electronics; beautiful but not practical for IDE control.
- Batteryless digital (practical): energy harvesting + MEMS mic + ULP MCU + minimal codec + short-range uplink (NFC/backscatter/solar puck).

We pursue the practical path first: NFC “tap‑to‑talk”.

## 4) Frequency–Energy Equivalence

Voice (pressure) → electrical signal → stored in a supercap → compressed frames → modulated field. Your words briefly become energy patterns that a nearby reader can decode.

## 5) The Developer Ritual

“Codimir: new ticket ‘Fix 404 on checkout’.”

Tap, speak, done. IDE/OS responds; tickets appear; builds run. The device is intentional by design (push‑to‑talk, visible log, allowlist actions).

## 6) Higher Bitrate Thinking

Clarity of intent reduces friction. Codimir I/O is bandwidth for your will: fewer steps between idea and result. Treat commands as atoms of creation.

## 7) What We’re Building (v0.1)

- Hardware: NFC harvester + supercap + MEMS mic + ULP MCU + coil.
- Firmware: field‑detect → VAD → ADPCM → framed chunks → NFC load modulation.
- Host: NFC reader daemon + CLI → WAV → SDK actions.
- SDK: local command grammar; adapters for IDE/OS/ticketing; allowlist + log.

## 8) Road Ahead (summary)

1. Feasibility: power + audio capture over NFC.
2. MVP: reliable 2–3s commands to IDE actions.
3. Always‑on variants: solar desk puck; optional USB hub.
4. Ecosystem: open designs, community packs, hack nights.

## 9) Call to Build

This manuscript invites engineers, designers, and thinkers to help compose the bridge between intent and execution. Contribute parts lists, code, circuits, language models, and rituals of use.
